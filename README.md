MATLAB implementations for Research Paper: Topology Optimization of Compatible Thermal Microstructures. (International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 2025)  
Note:  
topX_Dual_heat_V3.m is the basic implementation which only supports optimization of isotropic thermal microstructures;  
topX_Dual_heat_V3_granularity.m supports the interpolation method in Section 4.3 of the origin paper, which requires two given thermal microstructures as additional inputs;  
topX_Dual_heat_V4.m is an enhanced implementation that supports the optimization of isotropic and orthotropic thermal microstructures.
